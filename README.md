### Talk Intro: 

My personal mission is focused on how to use data to understand and improve yourself.  

Curious how you are being tracking? Ever wondered what you can do with your personal data? 

If you have an Android or iPhone, use a wearable like Fitbit, or even just watch videos on Youtube, then you already got plenty of personal data, and we haven't even started to formally track our lives. 

**What can we do with all this tracking data? Can it help you become a "better" version of yourself?**  

In fact, Python is one of the best tools for not only aggregating and collecting data; but python enabled you to do robust data analysis too.  

In this talk / workshop, we are exploring personal data, self-tracking, and personal data analysis. In the first part, I’ll show the basics on you how to track your life and all about the so-called "quantified self." In the second part on [QS Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger), I'll explain how to use Python and its data science toolkit (Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn, etc.) for data collection and to do your own Data Analysis and Visualization. Through some simple code, you can create your own Personal Data Dashboard.  

It’s easier than ever to track our lives, work and bodies with a smartphone, wearable, home sensor or computer. Bring together your personal data in interesting ways. Clean and process it. Find patterns with some simple data analysis. Make it beautiful with data visualization. Discover meaning, insights, and correlations using predictive analytics and machine learning. Finally, improve your life by transforming personal data into a data-driven life. 

In short, can self-tracking and personal data help us become more productive, healthier, and happier? I think it can. Learn how to engage with your data to be smarter, make more informed decisions and become data-driven!
