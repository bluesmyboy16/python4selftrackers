### Meta Note: 

These notes, talk slides and code samples are part of an on-going investigation at the nexus of personal data (i.e. from self-tracking, QS, service logs) and working with that data with Python (data collection, data processing, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning).

My overall aim is to help people to gain better self-understanding and empowered self-improvement through personal data. 

This is an active work-in-progress. See below for [Previous Versions](https://github.com/markwk/python4selftrackers#previous-versions) and [Related Writings](https://github.com/markwk/python4selftrackers#related-writings)

### Talk Intro: 

My purpose is help people to learn how to collect and use their personal data to better understand and improve yourself.  

Curious how you are being tracking? Already like many people today tracking your life but wondering what more you can do with your personal data? 

It’s easier than ever to track our lives, work and bodies with a smartphone, wearable, home sensor or computer. If you have an Android or iPhone, use a wearable like Fitbit, or even just watch videos on Youtube, then you already got plenty of personal data, and we haven't even started to formally track our lives. 

With a world of data, the question becomes: **What can we do with all this tracking data? Can it help you become a "better" version of yourself?**  

There are a lot of great ways to work with and use your personal data, even spreadsheet applications like Excel and Google Sheets and more powerful data visualization tools like Tableau and Google Data Studio can help. 

But if you want to become a master of your personal data, then one of the best tools is Python. Python is a great tool for not only aggregating, collecting and cleaning up your data. But python enables you to do robust data analysis and machine learning too too.  

In this talk / workshop, we are exploring personal data, self-tracking, and personal data analysis. In the first part, I’ll show the basics on you how to track your life and all about the so-called "quantified self." In the second part on [QS Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger), I'll explain how to use Python and its data science toolkit (Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn, etc.) for data collection and data processing. Part 3 looks at how to do your own Data Exploration, Analysis and Visualization on your own tracking data. Through some simple code, you can even create your own Personal Data Dashboard. Finally, in Part 4, we look at Machine Learning. We look at where ML is typically used for personal data and some examples of how you can use ML to better understand and improve yourself. In the conclusion, I share some of tips and recommendations for anyone wanting to pursue a data-driven life. 
 
Bring together your personal data in interesting ways. Clean and process it. Find patterns with some simple data analysis. Make it beautiful with data visualization. Discover meaning, insights, and correlations using predictive analytics and machine learning. Finally, improve your life by transforming personal data into a data-driven life.

In short, can self-tracking and personal data help us become more productive, healthier, and happier? I think it can. Learn how to engage with your data to be smarter, make more informed decisions and become data-driven!
